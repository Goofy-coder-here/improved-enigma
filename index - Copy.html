        <h2> Things I hate.</h2>
        <p> Nothing. I love eating whatever I get. As long as its edible it's good for me. I love talking with new people because I am quite of an extrovert. I have less friends but I want to increase my 
            friend circle. I love trying new things because of this curiosity to gain new knowledge, skill and other significant thing.
        </p>
        <p> I suggest other people also to keep peace in mind. Creativity and ideas is created in mind when you are free from all the stressing stuff and you will be free from those stuff once you stop hating.</p>

        <h2>People I am inspired by.</h2>
        <p>Although I said that there is nothing special about me but one thing about me that makes me a little bit different than other are my inspiration.
            I have been a science enthusiast since my childhood. I was kind of interested in astronomy and computers at the same time. Being an astronomer was out of reach as I was
            born in third world country, so I thought of becoming a pilot but it was out of my family's financial status then I was roaming through youtube on my sister's phone when I 
            found about Elon Musk. Despite not being a scientist, astronomer, and not even attaining a formal engneering degree, he is able to dominate space industry and keeps working
             on 
            amazing projects. He really gives me hope that I will be able to engage in the field of space exploration with the help of computer science. I hope to do 1 percent of what he
             has done but even 0.1 percent is hard to achieve.

<h2> Things I am currently working on</h2>
<h4> I am trying to learn something new everyday related to coding and I hope to complete html, CSS and Javascript by these upcoming 3 months because I have this 
    plan of starting my career as a freelancer then get into the real software development later after gaining necessary skills related to problem solving and creative ideas.
    Apart from coding, I am also working out on myself. I have been doing home and gym workout to maintain my health and develop healthy habits. Regarding my future, I would like to 
    be in the best place out there so that I can spend my productive age in a quality place.

       <h2> A little thing about me</h2>
        <p> I have no special ablities and skills but as we know there is always room for improvement, that's why I try to bring out the best version of myself.
            Back in the days(not long ago, just 1 year), I used to spend my time doing nothing. I was kind of a person that has no ambition, dream and plans but as time passed by,
            I had this deep concept developed in my mind which was to do something in the field of IT. I was unsure if it's going to workout and I still am but I enjoy 
            doing these things nowadays and I hope I will be where I want to be in the future.
